"""
This package provides a human-readable way to manage torrents on qBittorrent. The convenience of qBittorrent comes
largely from its feature to automatically manage torrents using categories. It should be highly recommended to enable
this feature to make full use of this package.

Users will be able to mass migrate torrents from one operating system to another, write scripts to move files and have
it reflect in the client, and many more.


Current requirements:
    OS: Linux/GNU based distros
    python >= 3.5
